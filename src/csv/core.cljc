  "CSV per RFC 4180, in portable `.cljc`. Zero dependencies.

  CSV looks like `split(\",\")` and is not. Everything hard about it is in the
  quoting rules, and every one of them is a case where the naive parser
  produces *plausible wrong rows* rather than an error:

  - **A quoted field may contain commas.** `a,\"b,c\",d` is three fields.
  - **A quoted field may contain newlines.** So a CSV record is not a line,
    and any parser built on `split-lines` is wrong before it starts — it is
    also the reason this cannot be a scanning reader: you cannot seek to
    record N without having read everything before it.
  - **A quote inside a quoted field is doubled.** `\"say \"\"hi\"\"\"` is
    `say \"hi\"`.
  - **Line endings are CRLF in the spec and LF everywhere in practice**, and
    a file with CRLF parsed as LF leaves a trailing `\\r` on the last field of
    every row — which compares unequal to the same string, silently, forever.

  ## What this does not decide

  **Types.** Every field comes back a string. `\"1\"` might be an integer, a
  zip code that must keep its leading zero, or a version number; RFC 4180 has
  no type system and inventing one here would make the parser's guess
  unrecoverable. A caller that knows the schema converts.

  **Whether row one is a header.** `read-csv` returns rows; `read-maps` treats
  the first as a header because a caller said so. A parser that sniffs for a
  header gets it wrong on exactly the files where every value looks like a
  name."
